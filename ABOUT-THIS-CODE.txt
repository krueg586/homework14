These two Java files are two parts of one assignment that I programmed.

'PathHeapQueue.java' sets up what is essentially a minheap data structure in order to function as a priority queue ADT, including all necessary methods to make it functional within the project.  
Everything within this file was done from scratch by me, except the content from lines 39-50.

'FindPath' is a file that takes in a graph (created by other files provided by the course instructor) that represents different locations that can be traveled to (like cities, for example) and all available paths between the cities. 
Each path costs a different amount to travel along (think like a plane ticket), and this file essentially finds the lowest cost path, but not necessarily shortest path, between two given cities. 
This file was a skeleton when I started it, so everything from lines 37-79 is my work.
